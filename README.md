# mcp-obsidian-bridge

Permissioned HTTPS bridge for local MCP development and testing.

## Safe Use / Permission Model

AIWander tools are local, user-authorized MCP capability surfaces. They do not grant an AI new permissions by themselves. They expose tools the user explicitly installs and enables. Sensitive actions should be confirmed by the user, credentials should stay in the OS keyring or local vault, and demos should use mock data.

## What it does

Claude.ai supports remote MCP servers ("custom connectors") over Streamable HTTP with OAuth. Most local MCP servers — like [Obsidian MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-obsidian) — use stdio. This package bridges the gap:

```
Claude.ai / Claude mobile
    ↓ (HTTPS)
ngrok tunnel
    ↓ (localhost)
mcp-obsidian-bridge (OAuth + HTTP → stdio translation)
    ↓ (stdin/stdout)
Local MCP server (e.g. mcp-obsidian)
```

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- **ngrok account** (free): [Sign up here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)
- **Obsidian** with the [Local REST API plugin](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) enabled

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the setup wizard

```bash
npx mcp-obsidian-bridge setup
```

This will ask for:
- Your **ngrok authtoken** (from [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken))
- Your **Obsidian API key** (from the Local REST API plugin settings in Obsidian)
- A **PIN** you'll use to authorize Claude.ai

### 2. Start the bridge

```bash
npx mcp-obsidian-bridge start
```

The bridge will:
1. Spawn the Obsidian MCP server as a subprocess
2. Start an HTTP server with OAuth and MCP endpoints
3. Open the configured HTTPS tunnel
4. Print the public URL

### 3. Connect from Claude.ai

1. Go to **Claude.ai → Settings → Integrations → Add custom connector**
2. Enter the HTTPS URL shown by the bridge
3. When the authorization page opens, enter your PIN
4. Done — Claude.ai can now access your Obsidian vault

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `mcp-bridge setup` | Interactive first-run configuration |
| `mcp-bridge start` | Start the bridge server |
| `mcp-bridge start -s <name>` | Start with a specific server config |
| `mcp-bridge status` | Show current configuration |
| `mcp-bridge add-server <name> -c <cmd> -a <args...> -e KEY=VAL` | Add a custom MCP server |

## Using with other MCP servers

The bridge is generic — it works with any stdio MCP server. Add a custom server:

```bash
# Example: bridge a filesystem MCP server
mcp-bridge add-server filesystem -c npx -a -y @anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem /path/to/dir
```

Or edit `~/.mcp-bridge/config.json` directly:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "obsidian": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-obsidian"],
      "env": {
        "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "your-key",
        "OBSIDIAN_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "OBSIDIAN_PORT": "27123"
      }
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem", "/home/user/documents"]
    }
  },
  "activeServer": "obsidian",
  "port": 3456
}
```

Then start with: `mcp-bridge start -s filesystem`

## How it works

### OAuth2 Flow
Claude.ai requires OAuth for custom connectors. The bridge implements a minimal OAuth2 authorization code grant with PKCE and Dynamic Client Registration (DCR):

1. Claude.ai discovers endpoints via `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
2. Claude.ai registers itself via `/register` (DCR)
3. User is redirected to `/authorize` and enters their PIN
4. An authorization code is exchanged for tokens at `/token`
5. Tokens are valid for 30 days with refresh support

### MCP Translation
The bridge translates between HTTP and stdio:
- Incoming: `POST /mcp` with JSON-RPC → write to subprocess stdin
- Outgoing: Read subprocess stdout → JSON-RPC HTTP response
- Sessions are tracked via the `Mcp-Session-Id` header

## Configuration

Config is stored at `~/.mcp-bridge/config.json`. Sensitive values (PIN hash, OAuth signing secret) are never stored in plaintext.

## Security Notes

- The PIN is stored as a salted PBKDF2 hash, not in plaintext
- OAuth tokens are 256-bit random values
- The ngrok tunnel URL changes on restart (unless you have a paid ngrok plan with reserved domains)
- Only you should know the PIN — it's what prevents unauthorized access to your vault

## Troubleshooting

**"Subprocess exited with code 1"**: The MCP server failed to start. Check that:
- Obsidian is running with the Local REST API plugin enabled
- The API key is correct
- The host/port match your plugin settings

**"Failed to create ngrok tunnel"**: Check that:
- Your ngrok authtoken is correct
- You're not running another ngrok tunnel (free accounts allow 1)

**OAuth authorization fails**: Re-run `mcp-bridge setup` to reset your PIN.
